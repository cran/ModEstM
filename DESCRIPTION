Description: Function ModEstM() is the only one of this package, it estimates the modes of an empirical univariate distribution. It relies on the stats::density() function, even for input control. Due to very good performance of the density estimation, computation time is not an issue. The multiple modes are handled using dplyr::group_by(). For conditions and rates of convergences, see Eddy (1980) <doi:10.1214/aos/1176345080>.
